# Understanding Transformers: The Future of AI

Transformers are a powerful AI model architecture introduced in 2017. They use **self-attention** to understand the context of words in sentences better than previous models.

- Process all words simultaneously
- Enable faster training and better understanding
- Used in models like GPT, BERT, and many others

## Why Transformers Matter

They revolutionized natural language processing by handling long-range dependencies efficiently. This innovation powers modern AI applications like chatbots, translation, and content generation.
